Learnt how to write/read binary files

Learnt how to use std::map<KEY,DATA> (c++ balanced BST implemented in black/red tree)

Write tree to a file
write_tree(TreeNode*) (pre-order):

  bfile.write(node)
  write_tree(node->left);
  write_tree(node->right)

read tree from a file
read_tree(TreeNode*) 

  bfile.read(node)
  read_tree(node->left)
  read_tree(node->right)


I think pre-order is the only way. If you want to readTree recursively, that means you have to start 
from root so you can use readTree(node->left) and readTree(node->right) recursively. That means the root should
be at the begininng, so you should write root first, which is pre-order.
