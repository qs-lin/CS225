I spent some time trying to figure out why # of iterations of DFS is smaller than # of valid points.
Actually this is quite obvious. Imagine on your figure, there are only two blocks are valid (<tolerance),
one is in the upper left corner and the other is lower right and they are seperated far away. So if you start from 
upper left, you will never traverse into the lower right corner due to the gap in between. so these two numbers are equal
only when tolerance is set to be very large so that all points are valid so there is no gap.
