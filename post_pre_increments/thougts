difference between pre-increment and post-increment:

pre-increment
format: T& T::operator++();
we notice here the return type is reference. 

The object has been incremented and the reference to this object will be returned.


post-increment
format: T T::operator++(int);
return type is by value.

creates a copy of the object, increments or decrements the value of the object and returns the copy from before the increment or decrement.

If the iterator itself is big, then pre-increment is more efficient since no copy is made in process.
